# Lambda Introduction

## Overview

Lambda functions are a core concept in many programming languages and frameworks. They represent small, anonymous functions that can be used and passed around like any other value. This README provides an introduction to lambda functions and how they can be used.

## What is a Lambda Function?

A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined with no name. While normal functions are defined using the `def` keyword in many languages, lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. The expression is executed and returned when the lambda is called.

### Syntax

```
lambda arguments: expression
```

## Benefits of Using Lambda

1. **Conciseness**: They are typically used for short operations that can be expressed in a single line of code.
2. **Inline Operation**: They can be used inside functional methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.
3. **No Naming Needed**: Being anonymous, they can be used when a full function definition would be an overkill.

## Examples

Below are examples to help illustrate the concept:

1. **Python**

```python
x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(5)) # Outputs 15
```

2. **JavaScript (ES6+)**

```javascript
const x = (a) => a + 10;
console.log(x(5)); // Outputs 15
```

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Single Expression**: Lambda functions can only have one expression, which means they're not suitable for complex operations.
2. **Readability**: Overusing lambda can lead to less readable code.
3. **Debugging**: As they are anonymous, lambda functions can be harder to debug.
