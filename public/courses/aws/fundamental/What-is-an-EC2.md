# Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. With EC2, you can run virtual servers, scale computing capacity based on your needs, and only pay for what you use.

## Key Features

1. **Elasticity**: Scale up or down based on demand, ensuring you only pay for the compute power you use.
2. **Variety of Instances**: Choose from a wide variety of instance types optimized for different tasks.
3. **Customizable**: Select the operating system, instance type, storage, and network configurations.
4. **Integrated with AWS**: Seamlessly connect with other AWS services.
5. **Secure**: Utilize AWS's robust security and compliance capabilities.

## Use Cases

- **Web & Application Hosting**: Run web and application servers in the cloud to host dynamic websites.
- **Data Processing**: Process large amounts of data quickly with parallel processing.
- **Backup and Storage**: Store critical data and achieve greater fault-tolerance.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Carry out high-performance computing tasks without investing in physical hardware.
- **Development & Test Environments**: Quickly set up and tear down test and development environments.

## How It Works

1. **Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**: This is like a template that contains the software configuration required to launch your instance.
2. **Configure Your Instance**: Choose instance type, storage options, and network settings.
3. **Secure Your Instance**: Set up security groups (like a firewall) that define which traffic is allowed in and out of your instance.
4. **Launch**: Once everything is set, you can launch your instance.
5. **Manage & Monitor**: Use AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to manage and monitor your instances.

## Pricing

Amazon EC2 follows a pay-as-you-go model. You're charged based on the instance type and the number of hours your instance runs. AWS offers a free tier for new customers which includes limited usage of EC2 each month.
