Solidity offers features such as:

- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Solidity code is compiled into bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Security**: Solidity includes security features to prevent vulnerabilities such as reentrancy and integer overflow.
- **Interoperability**: Solidity contracts can interact with other contracts and external systems through function calls and events.

## Solidity Development Environment
